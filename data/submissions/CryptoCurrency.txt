Would you sacrifice 4 years off your lifespan to go back in 2017 with the knowledge you have now about crypto? I kinda would no joke, wanna hear other responses
Everyone!

Notice that Reddit coins are on sale? Well, if you haven’t, they are.

I may or may not have bought a few, so if you want an awesome award, comment back.

In the mood for giving!

QNT isn’t done yet. I thought I was too late FOMOing in at $320 & it has jumped to $360 in 2 hours.

Why is selling at a profit so much harder than buying when it's down?

All I want for Christmas is $5 matic and .50 cent VET. Is that to much to ask for?
Making Quant my second biggest bag besides LUNA, when it was $10, was a good life choice.


Cheers crypto
Quant is on roid with 43% up and now $321.33

One of the best things you can do once your crypto pops off is reinvest it in your health.

Buy a nicer bed to save your back. And chairs! Better quality toothbrush to make your teeth last longer. That healthy bread that you wanted but couldn’t afford? Now you can. Your health matters now! Not in 20 years.
Congratulations to the all LINK holders

^(Little bit jealous I don’t hold LINK)

Woke up to grandpa BTC pumping. What a start to the day!
Finally got the newborn to sleep, time to turn in. Thanks for the entertainment the last hour y’all, and yes she has a small crypto bag being built for her.
The daily is legit the only thing to do when you’re up at 3 am trying to get a new born to bed.
If you don’t have charts on your second monitor, there you go.

BTC 51671 ; +3.00% ![gif](emote|btc2_emote|btc2)

ETH 3959.5 ; +0.99%![gif](emote|eth2_emote|eth2)

BNB 502.8 ; +1.47%![gif](emote|binance3_emote|binance3)

ADA 2.9 ; +0.13% ![gif](emote|ada2_emote|ada2)

DOT 34.46 ; +5.90%![gif](emote|polkadot_emote|polkadot)

SOL 146.0 ; +3.46%

XLM 0.393 ; +3.79%

LINK 34.56 ; +13.3%![gif](emote|chainlink_emote|chainlink)
The patience has finally paid off! The sleeping giants are moving.

Chainlink (+13.24%)
Algorand (+14.18%)

Congrats to all my fellows holders!
LINK never over-hyped, always working away in the background.

Right now: $33.35 ![gif](emote|chainlink_emote|chainlink)
ALGO keeps going! Currently at 1.308$ up over 9%! Where will it top out?

omgggg QNT almost $400 incoming
After a turbulent couple of months, market has surged by 47% in the previous 30 days, adding $0.73 trillion in value. 

Indeed, market value is $2.28 trillion now, up 2.27% in one day. Quantitatively, the crypto market volume has risen by 4.81% to $134.82 billion in the previous 24 hours. 
unpopular opinion; actual unpopular opinion: the daily is the only good part of this sub. the moon farming circle jerk posts are fucking annoying
Switched from stocks to crypto in June. Today I have double of what I put into it. I know, everybody is a genius in a bull market and I haven't realized the gains yet but I am hard as Palladium microalloy glass everytime I look at my wallet.
VET and XRP breaking out and finally giving me some good profits. Bought at the top in April and did some DCA. Finally in the profit now!
Not counting Coinbase because we don’t know it. Matic supply hanging at 3% remaining. I assume this allows for such large shifts in price with little movement. Going to be an amazing September for Matic with all its news and developments including burn implementation. If you were looking for entries, you got handed one perfectly today. Not financial advice.
LINK and VET are easily my best purchases
If you reached financial freedom tomorrow (where you don't HAVE to work anymore to live comfortably), what would you actually do?
It's my cakeday! WOOHOO! 9 years of loyal Redditing gone down the drain.
I hope It isn’t bad that I'm trying to sell all of my old stuff for more crypto money?
Solana is up 46% from last week! Let’s gooo! :D

![gif](giphy|BPcL0fnVqoBGwfcJxs)
Algo with good news ahead, might go for the ATH soon.
Ethereum is up 986% since last year
I bought ICP at 600, ask me anything…

And yes, I am still mentally and financially depressed about this lol
Last time BTC closed daily over 50400 it rallied to 57500.

Last night BTC closed a Daily over 50400 and it is on its way to 57500.
Coingecko is becoming a compulsive liar.
I can't wait for the market to go crazy all at once so the moon talk will stop.  When it's too much like tonight it's annoying
LINK, it's your time.... Go for it buddy!
LINK is the hot coin of the hour. Any guesses for the next pumper?
[cancellato]
Crypto debit card cashbacks are dope, just got 2% CRO back from my girlfriend's pregnancy test. Bullish!

**Stellar (XLM)** are meeting with **president of Ukraine** to discuss future of currencies in Ukraine

"The country is calling on Stellar (XLM) to create an infrastructure on which to base crypto projects and possibly a Ukrainian **central bank digital currency**."

That's HUGE for adoption and everyone should be talking about it

Population of Ukraine : 43,993,638
What's with the sudden turbulence. Fasten your seatbelt and HODL boys.
If the overall market has a day to cool off and reset some RSI's a bit, shit is gonna fly this week.
 Is this ever happened to you that you hesitate to buy a coin and the next day that coin gets pump.
XLM back to .40.  Nice nice nice
I dont know why ALGO is pumping but Im loving it! 

![gif](giphy|n98BI9GgS6KxbplK1Q)
God bless my third world country for thinking crypto has no value. Enjoying 0 taxes life to the fullest.
Don’t mind LINK; only up 17% today.

![gif](giphy|NVBR6cLvUjV9C)
Fiat mining done, portfolio at ATH, beer in a fridge. Ain’t life grand?
SOL and FTM pumping together again!
Bitcoin just closed above $50,000 on the weekly close for the first time in 17 WEEKS!  
  
After closing above $50,000 on the daily close for the first time since May.  
  
Buckle up boys.
Who has a little regret of not buying more 2 months ago lol
life is better when your free BAT is worth $1
I'm almost 100 percent up in my portfolio. Dawn. It make you realize how crazy this space is.
Keep going ALGO

$1.31 to $1.4 eod

Burnt the fucking hotdogs while checking the charts, now every kid at the cookout has to have a burger. Bullish on these beers though!
holy fk

QNT breaks ATH after ATH

$335
ATOM is holding up quite nicely

![gif](emote|atom2_emote|atom2)![gif](emote|atom2_emote|atom2)![gif](emote|atom2_emote|atom2)
Inflation is stealing your wealth without you even noticing. Crypto helps you to protect it.
QNT can you please stop rubbing my mistake in my face? i sold at 20 FML
Quant bounced.

![gif](giphy|op2Br9pDuAIQo)
Don’t sleep on quant, this is what it feels like to be early
Not knowing how to sell moons protected me lol
Wake up to BTC at $51K and FTM $1.27. Such a lovely day to start
I came for the link marines
LINK beats LUNA and DOT, very impressive
Hope LINK ![gif](emote|chainlink_emote|chainlink) can pull a Quant

Keep going boi

![gif](giphy|WGULilPb0FA5KBVQQx)
Wow, looking at BTC knocking 52K looks surreal! Come on BTC.
I'm very curious to see how girls wil treat me after moon distribution
My head says take some profit. My heart says buy more.
Sometimes decisions are hard.
Finally LINK with some action. Us holders have been patient af
I sold 10% of my holdings. Based on my luck, everything will pump soon

You're welcome ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dancing_wojak)
Lowest price you paid for FTM? I just want to know your entry points. Mine 0.79
Buckle up people!! We are going for another ride up!!
which stable coin do you prefer to keep your money in for long term?
Vechain is flying now! Let's go to 16 cents now! ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|to_the_moon)
VET BROKE RESISTANCE NOW ITS AN UNSTOPPABLE TRAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Investing in crypto is risky.

Not investing in crypto in this age is riskier.
Doesn't matter how much crypto you hold, if you're here, you are already better off than 98% of the world who didn't invest in crypto yet
I have $200 to spare today put into vet or buy ergo? I’m thinking maybe also buy more xrp but I already own that
FOMO begins soon, people who missed out will throw their money into crypto.
September is the month for Link, Atom and XML. They all started serious moves.
Mum, VET is doing the thing again
i always tell people if you believe in an asset, any day is good day to start buying. if you think it will go up, buy now, buy more when it dips. DCA. if you dont think it ll go up.
Oh no I was up 500% and now im up 487% 

/s
Who were the paper hand fools who sold?
Dip? Where!? I can’t see it!

![gif](giphy|w0vFxYaCcvvJm|downsized)
If ur wondering if it’s “too late” to get into Bitcoin, just know:

Was hanging out with some of my 85-115 IQ friends this weekend.

All of them think that it’s “a scam” still.

Do with that what u will.
Micro-cap tokens are so much fun. One day your down 20%, next day they reach new ATH
My coins are like childeren to me, if they don’t preform good I’ll sell them
I feel like a crypto boomer, I mostly own BTC and ETH. All you cool kids with your alts and big gains ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|safu)
If I ever become a millionaire, I’m going to come back to this daily and donate one moon every day for an entire week to a random moon farmer.
Holy shit ! LINK and FTM are melting faces
LINK and ALGO are carrying my portfolio! I never thought I’d ever type that sentence
Most of you buying Bitcoin and other solid cryptos right now have no idea how wealthy you are going to be a decade from now.
It's official, no red in my portfolio except VET. Ya boi bought in at $0.23 hahahahahaha (kill me)
"It's too late to buy bitcoin, it's expensive"..

If you buy bitcoin right now,you are earlier than 99% of people on earth..

It's still so early!!
SOL's run really is something special. Where's the ceiling??
Solana continues to climb. Called it a month ago; now it’s up 3.5x since I bought in.
Algo trying to push that 10% for just today!
How can you watch Solana over the last month and not get on board
Literally just got the email about approval for the CB debit card! So stoked right now!!
DOT just casually continuing its way to $40
Who is giving these awards? Btw FTM is doing really good.
Sol can’t stop won’t stop
Guys, I might be obsessed with SOL. Thinking of buying more.
Just realized /u/Hodler3k tipped me 101 moons! WTF dude!? Absolute legend. Thank you!!! ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|this_is_gentlemen)![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|this_is_gentlemen)![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|this_is_gentlemen)
I don’t give a damn what crypto you're invested in, I hope you make a ton of money regardless.
LINK is actually catching pretty well today

Up 9.9%

![gif](emote|chainlink_emote|chainlink) = $33.03
If you could rate yourself from fear to greed 1 being fearful as you possibly can and 100 being as greedy as you possibly can. Where would you rank yourself from

1-100?
Not many better feelings in the world than to jump into clean sheets and watch the charts and your coins pamp
Link had a good day yesterday, but I believe it was just the start.
Link looking like its next
Everyone forgot about LTC lol
FTM up 7% in the last hour
LINK might go off all week in a big way
Some Important Dates:

September 8th - [Moon distribution day](https://ccmoons.com)

September 12th - Cardano [ADA] Alonzo Hard Fork

September 25th/26th - Cardano Summit 2021

September 30th - Terra [LUNA] Columbus-5 Launch

Fantom coming in with yet another ATH. Top 20 is now inevitable
Algo sitting over $1.30! Noice, noice, noice, noice.....smort
It seems QNT isn't going to the moon, but about to fucking blastoff to Mars to setup a new colony
i currently hodl .015915 ALGO—wen hundred-aire?
*Fun fact*

There is literally a coin named ShitCoin listed on Coingecko 

The ticker is SHIT

The price is $0.000000259950
Hoping for a green month ahead! Let’s do it!
What the hell is AMP and do i throw $10 at it in case of a random pump
[rimosso]
Dam this fomo/addiction problem of mine
Bitcoin above 51k and nowhere as much noise as last time. Time will tell how high we go above the ATH when retail Noobs FOMO in!!!
I just want my investments to go up everyday by a small factor of 10-20% is this to much to ask?
I just realize how much 50 comments a day actually is.
so annoyed, i'm holding onto fiat waiting for a dip. no dip in sight :(
Does anyone like ANKR? I liked this coin months ago but haven’t kept up with it lately
Imagine buying a bond in 2021. Who TF are those people lol
Whats your price prediction for LINK till EOY?
It's very hard to take profits after holding and researching about the projects. Even after a 100% gain! I'm in stocks too and after a single 60% I'm happy to take it. It's incredible how the brain works with crypto money, im learning about DCA out strategies as we speak.
FTM with another +25%  -   absolute monster!
Why people just shilling other subs today.

Remember, no other subs give you moons
Can someone explain to me what does this symbol in front of everyone’s username mean, they seem to be added recently
Come on MATIC.. you can do this daddy
Coinmarketcap is still at 0.23+ but coingecko moons at $1.31 . I have to be dreaming
CoinGecko just said Moons were $1.56 I checked HoneySwap and they are $0.12 … What is going on lol?
Now that's the excitement I expect from crypto!

$0.23 to $1.56 to $0.15
+12% in 24 hours. Damn Algo tOkEnOMiCs!
F to the people who sold at 0.15 thinking the price was 1.31
Can i mine moons ? I made my vault but don´t know how to get them ?
Tomorrow's update: LINK jumps 33% to 44.52$
Night time pumps mess up my sleep schedule
Can we touch 52k mark today?
Still patiently waiting for my $100 to turn into $1 million. Soon
Always have the dilemma, whether I should keep DCAing in the coins I already have or keep investing in new ones? What do you guys suggest?
Broo chainlink is going insane right now

![gif](giphy|NVBR6cLvUjV9C)
Invested in everyday green for me haha , hard to hodl nowadays 

ETH , BTC , LINK , ADA , SOL , BNB , CELR , 

The only guys who're asleep in my portfolio are DOT,STMX,KSM & MATIC

I'm hodling till it meets my goals though
My man ATOM just casually killing it.
ALGO doing great. My favorite coin.
Why is no one talking about VET anymore? It just made a cup and handle on the daily
BAT is almost a dollar now. At $0.98 now. 

How much BAT have you earned till now?
Once I made 40k from Crypto and started my dream life

I'll become a full time DCA HODLER
Is Star Atlas legit? As in the development team are real and working on the games?

I watch some interviews and i like the concept of the games. Feels like Eve online. And i like playing a role in a game.

However i cant help but to equate Star Atlas with Star Citizen. With all the side content being sold currently such as nft+ship, feels like im preordering a game that i wont even know what the gameplay will look like. Plus it gives the feeling that the bulk of the money are from the side content and i dont know whether the developer will rugpull.

Is my concern invalid?
Coming back from a weekend without the charts, and boy LINK has had a good weekend!
Just saw some girl on TikTok say that she *manifested* this bull run
It will become a norm to incentivize people participation and contribution on various platforms in coming years 

Moons are ahead of its time and will be known as one of the pioneer projects in rhis regard
Elizabeth Warren Calls Crypto ‘The New Shadow Bank’

Whats up with this woman?
 This bullrun will be amazing
So happy to hold some LINK!
What's the highest amount of moons u tipped or were tipped?
I was tipped 3 moons by u/Xrporbrust
Imagine all Salvador would dump their BTC once they get it ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|fomo)
Would you agree that ALGO is the currency of the future
What are the one thing you should stop buying so you can buy more crypto? Mine are ciggaretts daamn i waste so much fiat on that
Hold on to your hats, this bull run is gonna be insane!

Had some guy slagging off my Ada investment yesterday, i said “I’m not too upset with my 3,500% gain”. He retorted “you will be when it’s a 3,500% loss.  

SMH some people.
What's carrying your portfolio right now
I feel like there won’t be a bear market this year, from my 8months of crypto investing.
ETH was $330 just 1 year ago.
Alright, hear me out.

We called XLM a stablecoin, it went up. We called ALGO a stablecoin, it went up.

^(I’m now bullish on USDT)
"I'll stock up on more Algo once the prices dip back closer to $1."

Meanwhile Algo go brrrr

Oops
XLM finally started to move!
Wow Bitcoin just hit 52k...what a wonderful way to start the week.

Guys don't watch one minute charts like me, it's not good for your mental health xD
Has anyone else found obsessing over crypto to be a good mental distraction from other stressors in your personal life?
Ah, the other side of the pond is definitely awake...
Crypto feels like the only neccessary investment at this point
My only regret is that I don't have more money to buy SOL
Does anyone here have a bag of ankr? Looking to get a small bag myself.

One of my favorite things about investing in crypto is it never closes! 24/7 365
Is it me or is every coin currently undervalued and once it pumps people are starting to see its potential
I received some comments in the notification bar. When I opened certain comments they get disappeared. This happened with me alot of time. Is it a reddit glitch?
Been away from the crypto world for nearly 4 days and it was glorious. No Internet reception anywhere. Think we should  all unplug for a couple of days each month it's good for the mind and soul... but back to business now how's my beautiful eth doing
Moons at $1.56 earlier today wtf was that??
I have a better idea. Let's all send $30 to my wallet and I'll do one huge buy
When did you started your Crypto journey & are you in profits or still in loss?
I root for alts that I don't even hold, because we're all in this together, fam.
LINK and ALGO were sleeping giants, we all knew it. Hope you all loaded up while you could :)
What's up with ALGO? Glad I randomly decided to drop some money on it last week.
BAT is such an under appreciated token. Such a solid team, working product and future plans. I think it will rip when the DEX and Wallet are launched. Who here is a BAT fan??
Thanks FOMOers for making our wallets fat.
Hey! I'm trying to learn more about crypto and investing in crypto, but it's hard to find quality content in the middle of hundreds of "Get your investment x300 back in 2 months" or "Can BTC/ETH/SOL/ADA get to $X?" kind of posts.

Beginner level but constructive (to prompt a more 'educated' DYOR) is the profile I'm looking for and just don't seem to find apart from maybe the InvestAnswers YouTube channel.

Thanks in advance.
![gif](giphy|lBs73ZcodnfDWAGeEw)
LINK and ALGO.  I repeat: LINK and ALGO.  Please be advised.  You are clear of all satellites and your path is clear!
When did you realize crypto was a thing? I joked with my friends buying btc 6-7 years ago. I regret I didnt buy any
$SOL pushing at $150 again…
Anyone else hesitant to even think about selling due to the headache of sorting out taxes.
All aboard the Algo train
What’s one alt coin that you think will have a huge bull run soon
I seriously thought I was an idiot for buying SOL at $80
Bought a bag of SOL at 137.  Felt funny then.  Feels good now.
Crossed 155 SOL. The next psychological level will be 160, but the target is 175 short term. Let's see what happens!
Solana is unstoppable... Fair fricking play to people who got in early
I'm tired of not FOMOing into SOL, it never stops!
Yesterday’s matic was better than today’s
ALGO is going bonkers. Got in at .75. Loving the price action. Its highly undervalued still
I did it.  I have one whole Tether.
Another day. Another sol pump I’m not apart of. Disgusting.
SOL will eventually be top 3 in MC this cycle behind Grandpa and ETH. Feel pretty confident about that.
SOLANA is literally on FIRE, 65% up in last 7 days, over 250% up in last 30 days & now it finally broke that 150$.
Blink twice and SOL breached another ATH again lol
Wtf sol man whaaat. Still regrets
Loving the love that Link and Algo are getting today in here!
Congrats to all SOL holders
Bull runs cause sleep deprivation
Shout out the people that were telling people to not buy SOL at 75, 90, 120, 140 dollars etc etc.
I have only 5 SOL but I’m holding it holding it 4ever. Or maybe till the end of September
And on the sixth day, crypto god said.....
200 bucks on vet, hope it goes to mini moon aka 16c
Just bought more LINK, you’re welcome for the pump guys!
Money can be made or lost in the short term, wealth is built over the long run. HODL and take small profits on the way up!
I have FOMO and Fifty dollars where would you throw it ?
In this distribution, only about **2 870** people will be earning 100+ Moons. (530\*0.1885)

If you are in this group, you're already in an *incredibly* small group of investors! 

And we haven't even hit MainNet yet...
There was a bit of a dip earlier today so I grabbed some more SOL and DOT. Crypto is going back up, BTC almost $52K and ETH is almost $4K. Saweet!
I'd like to dedicate this green dildo to my bank that can go duck itself.
Whoever loves mini dachshunds gets my wholesome award. #TeamWeen

What the fuck was that candle??
Left this subreddit for two weeks to focus on grad school apps... I can finally post!
Is BAT worth holding onto? I have about $70 worth but thinking of selling and putting that money elsewhere into ADA or ETH.
New to crypto. Heavy in stocks. Suggestions on coins to invest in long term?

Could Bitcoin be made by a single person? It seems to me like such a nearly perfect project that it's hard to grasp how an individual could figure it all out. If Satoshi isn't a group of people, then he/she would be my candidate for the greatest person of the 21st century
XRP, XRP, and XRP. Which do you think I should buy more of for my portfolio?
Well it’s 3 AM now in Europe. I’m going to sleep. Should’ve went earlier but I stayed up, again, looking at charts. Goodnight and I hope we’ll all have more gains in the morning
I hold a bit of QNT and up 200%+. Feeling fomo....

I could easily swap tezos and algo DCA for QNT. It's not like XTZ and ALGO are going to double up while I do this....sigh... 

I swore against doing swap trading....

Price discovery sucks :'(  Bear markets are probably easier for long term investors...
Reminder: store your seed phrases in a safe place! You don’t want to be apart of this now, but not be able to access the fruits of your labor in the future!!!
i always know the moment i have to take profits and i always dont. this is that moment.
BTC getting closer to $1t market cap
I got into the market in June and I gotta say this is the most excited I've been about crypto so far. I want to experience a bull run with everyone
I know we're up but I'm not effin selling! I have this odd feeling that we can go parabolic still.

So, i have some doubts and questions around my mind that are probably stupid for most of you but i think its better just to ask Then to keep it to myself..thank you in advance.



1- I used binance when i started buying cripto...reading alot of bad things about it.
I sent my eth and xrp to nexos and using the 1 month fix term there.
I was looking around celsius and the flexible rates are pretty good compared to binance so i was thinking...sending my btc there since i can sell it on a emergency...

Nexos for fixed terms and celsius for flexible? Or just stick with nexos and binance?

I actually never cashed out on any cripto so far..so dont know if any is not eu friendly between nexo/binance/ celsius to send to my bank account/ revolut account  the fiat earnings.

---------------------------------

2- I have a 50€ budget to spend on crypto every month, i have BTC/ETH/XRP/ADA.
Should i just buy every month 50€ of any of this or since im holding on to them...should i just keep the money aside and then buy a bigger amount of Crypto for a cheaper price when the bear market hits?.


This are the biggest doubts around my noob head so far...
What is your ultra bullish Bitcoin prediction??
Matic and Algo moving is about time they did they are going to pump more this week
With ETH gas of 92 gwei, I’m sure MATIC will be bullish this week.

![gif](giphy|V0jM5F7Ahl4ysyJfHf)
Matic is on the way up. 

It's going to pump overnight while I'm asleep again, probably.
Just a heads up we always crash right after the crypto market moves into flavor of the week shenanigans.
Good morning fellas, how we looking today?
My goal for moons is 6.2k. At that number, if moons market cap hits the same market cap as doge coins ath, those moons would be worth close to 1 million usd
Its really nice seeing common names in this thread, I really feel like we are a community. Sometimes I flame y’all for saying dumbass shit. Don’t take it personally, just don’t say dumbass shit. Love you all a tonne.
Got my first full ETH just over the course of the summer! High schoolers are so eager they'll pay 3x the actual cost of cigarettes and booze and you get to DCA the difference. Legal weed coming soon where I live might give profits a substantial boost.
Change my mind, the only people impacted by the 50 cap rule are those who don’t have the time to make 10 accounts.
Coin : *pumps*

Shill : I shall play you the song of my people
C'mon ETH do a 4000 already
Fantom top gainer over last week and not slowing down. Belongs in top 20 at least.
What  portion of your portfolio is in crypto?
Wtf is going on with moons
Not gonna lie. I’m a bit pissed off at the Cardano dex devs that launched a faulty dapp on the testnet and caused a shitstorm of fud. 

I need to cash out some of my holdings next week to help with a house purchase. Now gonna be beating myself up when other dexes release their Dapps after I’ve sold and Ada price pumps.
Why are moons suddenly worth $1.31 on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moon)?!
Anyone here use the brave browser? Do you like it?
I got my cyrpto debit card an am so chuffed
Just woke up to moons at $1.31 and if this is legit, i want to confess that im in crypto for 2 years now but i never feltsuch shear happiness so far. Congrats to everyone
Selling Ada for Qnt was the right move it seems, happy portfolio today.
Fomo says: forget about SOL, buy QNT
lmao this is so funny

coingecko glitch moons to take a dump
Last night BTC had a first 50k daily close since May. 

Still not bullish?
Volume on moons 200k$, someone cashed out big time :-/
Wait, so coingecko showed moon at $1 and people dumped and it was actually at $0.27 and went to $0.15. Fuck thats a bit sad.
Will moons be the only cryptocurrency made by reddit, or is the plan to make one for each of the big subreddits?
Good thing I have no idea how to sell Moons.
Tomorrow when everyone wakes up they’re going to freak the F out lol
Favorite coin outside top 20?
I wonder if 10 years down the road…there will be articles about this sub similar to the Bitcoin forums
BTC holding 51k makes me happy next 55k!!!
Really loving the strong momentum of MATIC in the short and mid term. Bullish!!!
Wtf happened to moon today why was it over $1?
CURRENT PRICES

![gif](emote|btc2_emote|btc2)$51,744.45

![gif](emote|eth2_emote|eth2)$3,930.9

![gif](emote|binance3_emote|binance3)$499.53

![gif](emote|moon_emote|moon)$0.2626
Which cryptos do y'all think have the best names and/or logos? What are your favourites? Personally I still think Ethereum has a very high standard set.
If the moon spike to $1.50 was a glitch, then how come the Blockchain shows this massive transaction of 90,963 moons around the same time?

[https://testnet.redditspace.com/tx/0x2ae6b26e2557532945fcf163aa787331293c5edca5819a4dbb622e5b4c040920/token-transfers](https://testnet.redditspace.com/tx/0x2ae6b26e2557532945fcf163aa787331293c5edca5819a4dbb622e5b4c040920/token-transfers)

The buy order could have come from Uniswap2 which CMC doesn't show.
Seems like I made a very good decision by adding link.  

It is currently at $34.53 and 15 billion market cap. 

A lot more is on the table given it can partner with any programmable blockchain
So moons dumped to $0.12 then pumped back to $0.25. Dips being eaten up. Bullish af.
Step-link what are you doing?
All I want is to own 1 full BTC. Is that too much too ask?
If BTC pumps today and consolidates, altcoins will skyrocket
Dreamt DOT hit 80$. Bullish
LINK and DOT are buddies again.
Member black Wednesday May 19th?

I member..

Also remember saying in a while we’ll al have a laugh about it, and look at us now! Ppl will be saying we were lucky but fck that, we deserved this. Let no one take that away from you.
Good morning shitposters and chart watchers. How are we doing today?
New LINK all time high is coming this week. 


You heard it here first.
can September pump?  


will there be a big red dump?  


'asking for a friend...'  


*-the daily Daily haiku*
Realistic LINK price prediction in this run?
I won't be happy until LINK is atleast $60+ and DOT as well
Wow woke up and found our that moons momentarily shit up to 1.5$ wtf
What’s your end goal in crypto?
Would be amazing if Bitcoin can reclaim it's previous ATH in September.
Do you think ETH will make it over 4k today? Last time it was slapped down pretty hard.
LINK is lifting off - Ben mentioned it in his last yt video - coincidence?
I don’t think SOL knows how to go down
I made more money last 24h in crypto than my whole life in bank saving accounts. Period!!
Are we hitting 60k by the end of this month? BTC won’t stop climbing
Ethereum just closed the highest weekly candle in history!!
Popular opinion: LINK is undervalued and is gonna pump to at least $70 soon. Maybe even $100 if the FOMO kicks in that it might fly as SOL.
ALGO seems like a strong racehorse! Let's go for more green days.
So glad to see so many "I voted" badges in this thread. 

WELL DONE FOR VOTING
Last stop before ATH boys
When LINK staking is announced, that will be the day many people will realize why we told them to buy LINK
whats the difference between coinbase and coinbase pro?
Who are all the people actually using ETH? Are you all insanely rich?
Are we gonna see LINK in the 50$ someday soon?
LINK and DOT are price buddies again, finally.
Just transferred all my sol to hardware wallet and staked not touching until 2024, any advice on that? Thnx
It's ok, MATIC. You go when you feel like it.
If you look at the charts then you know XLM will run this week
ETH not feeling it today... Sometimes its better to take a sick day :-)
i took profit , thank me later.
That vet dildo. Breaking out with the boys
What is this gray icon in front of many Reddit users names including myself. A Dom like building in hexagon
LINK/DOT/ADA/ETH Are my biggest bags! So happy to see them perfomr lately! 

Crypto is truly amazing investment!
I will keep DCAing into BTC. I have a long term perspective.
I sometimes almost forgot that we are in CryptoCurrency subreddit not in Unpopular Opinion subredit. How many more "unpopular opinions" we will get...
Portifolio ATH baby! Funny how you feel like a genius whenever that happends and like an iditot on the days where we’re in the deep reds
Chainlink, chill! I can only get so erect!
Surprise XRP pump? We love to see it.
LINK is firing! About time! $40 here we come :)
Is it illegal for LINK and DOT to go separate ways?
XLM no longer a stablecoin

$0.41 now

![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dancing_wojak)![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dancing_wojak)![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dancing_wojak)
First moon is coming for me
XLM going “you thought I was a stable? Surpriseeeee muthafucka!!!”
How bland must the lives of people be, who don’t invest in crypto
What’s more stronger than ETH 3.9K resistance?
Are you guys also having trouble with CoinGecko? Can’t view my portfolio today.
The hardest part will be to know when to sell before the bear market
Serious question to those who have been in crypto since 2017: How do you manage to carry your giant, titanium balls around?
XLM will be at ATH in no time
When will XRP's time come?
Are you guys and girls all in in crypto or do you have other investments?
Woah my xlm finally doing something.
Salute to everyone that held during the May crash.
Whats your biggest crypto bags? Mine is ETH/ADA/LINK/DOT
Hello i am waiting to get moons since a lot of time when is the moon released and can someone tell me how many i got
Bitcoin at $52,000


And less than 24h for Bitcoin to become legal tender in El Salvador 


Have a good day everybody!
Still waiting for ETH to hold solid over 4k

Interesting that Kusama and Polkadot work so closely together. [Yayoi Kusama](https://japanobjects.com/features/yayoi-kusama-world) is a Japanese contemporary artist who often features polka dots in a lot of her work. Not a huge art nerd but it's pretty neat, so someone on the Kusama and Polkadot team has good taste . And when I think about blockchains and interconnectedness, I can see the resemblance in designs like [The Infinity Mirror Room](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/yayoi-kusama-infinity-mirror-rooms). Or I'm just high.
![gif](emote|nano2_emote|nano2)NANO is taking off!
Let’s send everything to the moon. Bears r fuk
I got only 69 moons this time :')
Does brave browser work on android cause i havent been getting BATs from using it on my phone?
Yesterday, I have switched my ADA for DOT. It seems like a good idea as I am already up a few % from DOT while ADA is slowly bleeding ( due to the smart contact issue I guess ). Feeling lucky
Nice to see XLM make some movement
[rimosso]
It's fun looking at the 15 min chart - binance one is having a stroke on Btc
Not that way! The other way!
Is crypto rigged? How does all coins just drop like that?
That’s a nice fall out of nowhere
So why is everyone started getting awards all of a sudden???
I will never financially recover from this. I haven't had a portfolio this low since...*checks watch*...yesterday evening.
Why is CKB being talked about with such conviction lately? Honest question. Genuinely curious.
Remember the golden rule

If there's something I learned recently in this market, it is to never panic sell the dip.
Wait what was that flash dip can someone explain?
Happy to be LINK hodler today! Cheers everyone!
Is CoinGecko messing up for anyone else?
Shoutout to everyone in the US that has to look at charts at work today. Holiday pay!

What a morning to wake up to. Green across the board. Crypto.com sponsoring yet another sport getting the name out there to more crowds. A bullish day for all
It appears that Bitcoin has found support at $51k. This is very good.
Bullish on ALGO before governance
My only wish is for the bears to remember this month as Rektember.
Bullish on my incoming +0.1645 BATs, gonna stack nicely on 0.5 BAT I already have
Crypto is the new ‘shadow bank’ according to Warren.  The difference is, this time YOU and I get to be a part of it!
Made $30 from a $100 operation in day trade. The other $70 I lost...
Who’s here for some ATHs , alt coins don’t want to stop..
 The goal is use your 20s to retire at 35..
Was the moon spike on the charts a glitch?

I used to invest in stocks before crypto but it didn’t feel addictive yet crypto feels that way, why is so? it’s almost the same thing
LINK overtook UNI in market cap
That was a good round of ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|this_is_gentlemen)**Crypto Riddles**, tonight. Nice to see some new faces getting in on the action. A lot of people saying Geico for the last one, but forgot that these are crypto-related (Geico = gecko + aggregator = CoinGecko). If you didn't strike gold this time, I hope to see you next round

Looking at Instagram makes me depressed.  

Making friends with anon accounts on crypto reddit makes me happy.
Go get your princess, Link!
VET, come on boy, its your time to shine to new ATH.
