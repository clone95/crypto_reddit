Seeing people in here bummed about their coins only doing 15% in a month.  Lemme tell you about a little thing called stocks...
today, i tendered my resignation letter. got in $FTM at 0.015. We're at $1.70. I love ya'll crypto brothers.
*BTC goes 2% down*

Alts: guess I'll die
I bought SOL at $40 now I'm shitting myself, when tf do I sell
Haha that e-mail Kraken just send: "optimism is returning to the crypto markets now that signs of a bear market have subsided."  Great timing there marketing division.
Meh. After May I’m totally numb to this shit lol.
I just started using Crypto a week ago and I'm already down $60 from when I started. 

10/10 would recommend to friends and family

The May crash changed me. I see red and I don’t really care that much.
This is actually insane. Mega coordinated
Sometimes I wonder how many people posting content here are teenagers with like $100 of their allowance
Money invested in crypto.
Wish i had the fiat to buy this dip but instead im just stuck watching helplessly lmao
FTM is up by 401.72% for the past 30 days, while SOL is up by 347.65% also for the past 30 days. 

Congrats to everyone who hodled!
A couple of well timed moves and I have successfully turned my $3 FET reward from Coinbase into $2.07!
ETH at $3450 pump: its over I'm too late.        

ETH at $3450 dip: its over ETH is dead.
Retail - "Let's all buy $30 and pump BTC"

Whales -

Is anyone else losing money today?
Feeling nothing after the may crash.

Just few weeks of gains banished, and nothing more for now. Enjoy the ride, it can get even more kaothic in the next weeks.
I just bought into SOL. I could not take it anymore.
I feel like VET got hit by this dip the most
I freaking still can't believe i missed out on SOL !!
This sol run has been incredible
Picked up some more link and eth , just think about it, last crash BTC went to 29k? Now it’s sitting above 46k. Eth went to 1700. Now 3k? Keep raising the floor
El Salvador will officially make Bitcoin legal tender today. El Salvador bought 200 BTC(10m$) and the funds will go toward the country’s plan of airdropping $30 of cryptocurrency to its citizens.
Jealous of those with SOL. I am too smooth brained to have bought if at any point.
Literally saw Solana 6x itself before my very eyes
Call my portfolio Wyclef Jean cuz that shit’s Gone Til November.
Sol at $40. Buy it. No.  
Sol at $70. Buy it. No.  
Sol at $100. Buy it. No.  
Sol at $120. Buy it. No.  
Sol at $170. Buy it. Yes. FML.
People spreading FUD about SOL either shorted, missed the boat, or just have no clue.
I bought more sol now idgaffff
Oh no guys btc is at prices haven't seen since yesterday. Panik
Imagine the guy in el salvador who went on date with his girl and the market crashed.
What is the reason for crash?? or it’s a correction?
damn the markets like an roller coaster today btc litreally crashed from 50k to 42k and is going up to 48k
Big boys trying to create a retail panic. So obvious that this is planned and coordinated. Relax people. Don't fucking sell your coins back to them for cheaper.
In INVESTING always remember that Rome was not built in a DAY.....

In TRADING always remember that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed in a DAY....
basically solana to this dip

New daily! Hello all my crypto friends

![gif](giphy|xT9IgG50Fb7Mi0prBC)
ALGO getting it's little pump on
YouTube really is a cesspool for crypto scams. I watch one Hoskinson video and all of a sudden I get recommended streams of ADA giveaway scams. “Send 1.5k ADA to this address, we’ll send you 4.5k ADA back!” With a fake tweet from Hoskinson pinned at the top of the screen. Sickening.
I finally bit the bullet and transferred some crypto to a wallet for the first time ever. It was nerve wracking but it was good.
We see $53,000 tonight. Mark my words!!
Worth converting my ADA to SOL right now?
Not fomo-ing into SOL at $70 is slowly killing me
Congrats to all the SOL hodlers and whoever fomoed into it too because you’re doing great. I’ve decided that I’ve missed this boat for now as I can’t bring myself to fomo (ptsd). I’m sticking to my roots which are ETH and ALGO.
Holy Shit my ETH, ADA, LINK, INJ are all getting massacred right now.
There was $1.2B BTC liquidated, which created that dip, see https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/crypto-markets/futures/btc-liquidations
I’m down $14000 overnight lmao. Crypto is wild.
Don't forget, an important part of holding for 10 years is to check the charts every 5 minutes.
Solana… this is life changing money. Actually in tears. 5 years post kidney transplant, I’ve always thought I was behind my peers money and career wise. Crypto is life changing. I’m so close to a house deposit.
Someone is out here giving large amounts of awards… I salute you; however, I won’t be one-upped. 

We duel!
Love love love watching sol pump while I sit on the sideline, it’s really fucking fun being the dude losing money in the daily.
Apparently they should have gone with EL SOLvador
I recommend everyone gets a budget tracking app on their phone. Ruthlessly log all your income and expenses. I won't even pay a dollar for a cup of coffee without inputting it into my phone.

Then at the end of each month it will spit back where all your money went, and you'll be able to figure out what you can cut back on.

There are three ways to save more money.

Earn more.

Spend less.

And Invest.
Lol it hurts seeing SOL fly and not having any bags
Oh help! The money that doubled this month just went down 5%! Panic!
Enjoy your Moons you wacky logophiles and thanks for another successful round of ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|this_is_gentlemen)**Crypto Riddles**. See you all after the distribution!

If that dip happened in the stock market in a day that would mean world war 3 is about to start lol.
99% of people who asked for a dip probably not buying rn
Coinbase: “We want everyone to buy crypto!”

*People try to buy the dip*

“Not like thattttt”
I should give FTM a massage 




It's back must be hurting by carrying my portfolio
This dip is fucking insane. Most of these coins haven't seed these insane low prices since...

*checks charts*

48 hours ago.
Come on MATIC.. it’s ok to go up

Psssst you yes you now's the time to buy the coins that ARENT skyrocketing, not the ones that are

I keep FOMO buying SOL and it keeps going up
Just waiting for the bull run to really take off so I can feel good

Who else is watching SOL charts instead of sleeping?
bought 5 SOL. let's watch it tank now guys. sorry
Here’s the comment that’s NOT about SOL going crazy…

LINK has been performing well too! I’m up over 100%!
There's some very rich people off SOL, hopefully I'm on of those one day off ETH and MATIC!!
Ah SOL, your price keeps rising and my holdings stays the same. Zero.
ONE having a breakout. L1 season. Even LTO is having a bit of a run up with news of mainnet cobalt update and 4 new projects . Good times
People here will say SOL is crashing because it's hitting levels not seen since 45 minutes ago. lol
Markets go up: "Wen discount? Feeling FOMO"
Markets go down: "It might fall more. Better sell now and buy lower. "
few days ago we were crabbing at 49.5-50.5k 

We are back to it and some of u are shitting the bed. 

Go invest in stocks if its too much for u
Love how people's expectations go parabolic as a coin pumps. SOL pumped from $40 to $190 in a matter of weeks and now people are already calling $500 EOM and stuff life that.
I'm buying this ETH dip no one can stop me
Moment of silence for all the shitcoins we lost this year.
I've spent a very big amount of my shib gains back in May to buy some FTM at ATH just before the crash. Honestly i thought my money was long gone but i refused to sell at loss and waited for my moment and it finally happened. I dont have huge profits as i bought high but man does it feel good right now! Just hold friends, it will work out eventually
Day 819 of checking my wallet to make sure no one deposited something by mistake.


Still no, will update tomorrow.
My PF hit my personal target yesterday, and I let it all ride cause I got greedy. 

Fucking noob!
My portfolio just dropped 20% in the last twenty minutes. Crypto never makes me forget how wild it can be, haha
I survived the May i won't let today bring me down
This is so stupid. Why can't crypto show any signs of stability once.
Okay I dca’d instead of panic selling am I doing this right?
I am so happy that I survived May and June. I am calm as a lake. Thank you for this Elon
The main sub is entertaining…

Yesterday: We’re on our way to BTC over $100

Today: Sell everything
Other coins pump 10% XLM pumps 2%...

Other coins dip 15% XLM dips 25%...

Makes me want to scream!!!!!!
Today has just proved to me that no one knows what the fuck they’re talking about when it comes to crypto. We’re all out of the loop. 

Never a dull moment that’s for sure though.
This crash is bullish. It's the slow bleeds that are dangerous.
And now SOL is going for its ATH... what in the actual fuck
Panic sellers rebuying yet?
So I bought $500 worth of SOL an hour or so ago because I’ve been wanting to get skin in the game (FOMO I guess) — it’s already worth over $700. Win??
Isn't it funny how to exchanges always go down during these flash crashes, but "someone" is able to scoop up thousands of cheap coins at the bottom?
An important part of holding for 10 years is to check the charts every 2 minutes.
I SELL NOW.. THEN WHEN THE PRICE INCREASE I WILL BUY AGAIN
here's the daily trivia scratch 3 and share what did u get:

This time last year Solana was $1.09 !! (+6000%) 

Current price $179
Fuck me, I actually sold yesterday. First time in 3 years of trading of catching a top. My odds are terrible. Moral of the story, the longer you lose money the higher the chance of making 1 gain once in your life.
6 days until smart contracts drop on Cardano. Ignore the fud and hodl together!
Solana is almost 169!!!!!! Omfgg
My friend shilled a coin in my group chat

I asked why is that a good investment

He said "the price can go up"

At the rate btc is going, we'll be back to 60K in no time.
Its 5am here in France just weke up to see news about Bitcoin. Hope we will see a big green candle today
(Insert non SOL related post here)
Sol was the best Fomo ever. It just keeps going.
Sol at 183 boiz, up 43 dollars the last few hours wtf
SOL really wants that XRP spot on CMC
Wtf sol. Every day I woke up with regret not having bought.
Every time I don’t buy into SOL to ‘not FOMO’ it goes higher….
When two of the top 3 performing coins today are in your bag..... oh my that looks good! :)
Yolo’d all my alts into Solana back in April at $26 and decided against it and went the Vet route.. Feeling like a real McAsshole
I'm already way ahead of these people trying to buy $30 BTC and bought when it was $63,000

![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dancing_wojak)
My name is bthemonarch and I just fomod into Sol.
Aight so I think I'ma pick up some more moons tomorrow. Whatchu think it'll drop to?
So much hype this September. Bitcoin is officially legal tender from today. September 12 sees smart contracts in Cardano finally. October 1 governance proposal in Algorand. Not to mention BAT and moons distribution tomorrow!
do you still think Solana is pumping because of fomo or is this actually backed by something?
Guys just 9 billion more and 1 trillion marketcap on Bitcoin!!
man SOL is really reaching 200$ today
Only regret for SOL is not buying more.
Is SOL better tech wise than ADA or other smart contract cryptos?

I keep telling myself Im not gonna fomo in but my god....
What the hell with ADA? People "selling the news" before 12th?
SOL at $500 seems almost invevitable at this point.  When do you all think it'll happen?  2 months?  6 months?
Holding DOT at $35 is akin to holding ETH at $350. Why do I say that? You’ll find out soon enough.
Stay calm! This 5% dip is very normal, even in a bull market.
My streak of buying right before the dip lives on
how the hell does everything always dip together
Error 404: last weeks gains not found
ETH supply on exchanges hits record low.

ETH 2.0 staking is close to hitting 7 mil.

Accumulate as much as you can, I am pretty sure you don't have enough ETH.
Bought SOL at 39, watching it flying like a mofo at 180. The $1000 became $4500 in zero time, bravo Solana!
Bad news, we dropped 3k, good news - we held resistance
I don’t get this place sometimes. Did people really expect Bitcoin to increase on a forever upwards only trend? In other words, that we would just rise to $100k without a single small correction or red day? 

Even now with this ‘dip’ Bitcoin is holding above $50k. 3 days ago we were struggling to get over $50k. Not two months ago we were at nearly half this level.

This is just an easy/excellent opportunity to buy and/or DCA into whatever coin you prefer on the cheap.
One thing I don't understand about BTC - so there is a maximum supply that will be hit around 2040. At this point it must mean mining no longer results in any profit. So what is the incentive to continue to process the blockchain? Surely at that point it will no longer be possible to execute any BTC transactions.
What drugs is Solana on to keep rising so much? Asking coz my peepee could probably use the same
Lmao the so called "Dip" was yesterday's top charts. Calm down jeez
I still can't believe that FOMOing into FANTOM was the best crypto move I've ever done
HOLY FUCK FTM! JUST LOOK AT IT!
Damn it's super frustrating when you go to the trouble of answering a question in detail and when you send it, you get the error message that you can't post because the original comment has been deleted.
Finally. Today is the day I break even on all my coins! So glad I held on.

*Harmony you are the ONE today*
What do you guys do on red days like this
ALGO is going back up now. Hope you bought that dip I guess 

![gif](giphy|Cg3aIdbFiaFMsZaoY8)
I do not hold SOL and i hope it goes like this and holders get a lot of profit. However, please be careful with the FOMO, these percentages and recent performance might be corrected with a huge correction.

Just be cautious please.
Fantom still going

if you bought yesterday around the highs, dont forget to sell the lows now
I see that the strategy of Buying high and selling low is really paying off ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dancing_wojak)
I mean ETH is literally up 100% from 1 month or so ago. A little pullback wont kill. In 1 months time we’ll be at new ATHs
I love how this market still surprises people. We need this pullback, it’s not healthy to be green for too long.
Another opportunity to buy SOL.  This is a gift.
Golden cross soon right guys?
All in now, not selling. Hoping the charts look better later this week.

holy fuck COINBASE you just cost me a lot of money

how can such a huge company suck this fucking hard?
The fact that the exchanges can't handle volume lately goes to show that we are legit set to explode very soon, and I can't wait.
CB Pro turned us into diamond hands real mf quick
That was fucking mental. Never lost that much money that quickly, was starting think I had this whole crypto thing figured out haha
I don't understand why people sell now. Who on earth would you do that. When you hope it drops more you are gambling.
So is El Salvador more bankrupt now?
Thank you panic sellers I had a good time buying the dip.
I love everyone panicking like it wasn’t 46k a week ago.
Sol and FTM racing to who can recover the fastest
Some of us might find this useful right about now https://careers.mcdonalds.com/
I'll say it again if you missed it. Every exchange crashing and lagging because they can't handle volume lately is an amazing sign for a ridiculous bull run thats about to hit. The market is about to explode with this unprecedented volume. Time to kick back, relax, and watch the explosion in price as crazy volume and fomo take us to new highs to end the year. If you have target profit levels, it's time to set those sell orders for the upcoming run. Dyor.

Bitcoin = $46,771

Bitcoin is now at the same price that it was 7 days ago.
In my opinion the timing of this downward move, even though it was expected in September by the likes of Ben Cowen and others is to spite El Salvador for their decision to go against the worldwide financial institutions.

It won't work, but they clearly have an agenda to scare off other poorer nations for attempting to break free of financial control by greedy bankers and foreign policy

Manipulation at its worse, designed to hurt some of the poorest people.
once again crypto proving that nobody understands shit. technical analysis my ass
This was clearly not manipulation
Everything slowly coming up
Me when I am making gainzz: 

I am here for tech guys 

Me when I am down 10%: 

Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
last chance to "buy the dip" or the once in a lifetime oppurtunity to buy the "DEAD CAT BOUNCE".... fck it im buying the dip and will live with the consequences lol
If you were a bull and now are suddenly a bear, you're annoying.
So uh... did anything happen? I haven't read any news but I see my portfolio went to shit in like 10 minutes.
Literally only had $30 to afford in this dip :(
I was napping for the past 2 hours. Just woke up. What the heck?
Solana, what the fuck are you?
Big laugh at those calling a may crash an hour ago, my portfolio is already same value as yesterday lol $FTM $SOL
SOL already fully rebounded while the rest of my boats are still taking on water.
Watch SOL and QNT for relaxation.
Pay attention to the projects that are recovering quickly today. If your projects are sideways or still dipping, could be that it’s a stale project thats struggling to find a niche in the market or pickup meaningful adoption.
Can crypto help my bankruptcy?  


Yes, it accelerates it.
SOL......Its trajectory is meme worthy
Surely as a new day begins, the SOL always fucking rises
What the fuck was that Sol bounce back. That's like 50% up in a few hours
Imagine losing your shit because something your invested in takes huge dips but still has a 50% monthly gain.
Why do people no look at 20 week or any moving average / everyone is saying it’s the imf and big banks / what about us not testing support for weeks / and for the health of the market let’s say we test and hold it would be nicer than going straight up.
Fuck coinbase where do we go now

Why aren't you?
Cant FOMO into the dip since I was too busy buying the top.         

Best regards from a fellow buy high sell low trader.
Oh boy.. I DCA'd close to the bottom of the dip. Instant green. Amazing. And took some profits yesterday. That was a good thing, I guess.
Crypto flash crashes way too much. People over leverage and it's a cascade effect until a bottom is found.
Moons distribution tomorrow is the glimmer of hope in the sea of despair today!!
Person who claims 10% drop isn't a dip but calls 8% rise a pump.
For me that dip was discount to buy

119 ADA , 422 VET , 50 MATIC , 3 DOT 

Total $323 , could cost me yesterday around $400 , So that was good discount  

Do you agree ?

I am a 18yo F from Phillipines (if that matters) & I am new to Crypto & this sub. 

My most profitable trade was to buy 3 SOL at 80$ each(I bought it because it was trending no.1 on Binance a few weeks ago) & sell them at 173$ each.

It's more money than my mom & dad make in a month combined.

I want to know about everything like

1. Any tips to avoid loss or making more profits. 

2. When to buy coz I can only invest around 20$ a month. 

3. Which Coins are most Safe & which coins should I stay away from.

4. I already know about moons & brave browser, are there any other place I can earn free Crypto from? 

5. Where can I stake to get most interest from? Binance is offering very less interest on ETH & BTC.

6. Just your general advice.

7. Why there are already 2 people in my DMs asking for my seed phrase even though I don't have a Crypto wallet.
Maybe popular opinion but "Buy the dip" is the single most annoying phrase ever
Any fellow crypto chicks here? There's got to be tens of us
regret not putting my entire life savings on SOL at 22$
Bitcoin is so close to 53k!
I am HODLer,  but damn I am so impatient about moon distribution.  Distribution is not where HODL is in my brain, but rather with christmas gifts and packages ordered online. I can HODL for years, but waiting for gifts or online orders is completly different story.
Hmmm, seems it’s about time for ADA to pump again
I did it! I did it! I did it!  


*I am now the proud owner of \*1 Solana!*  


Sorry it's probably about to crash, maybe wanna sell your bags quick.
[cancellato]
This will sound dumb and risky but it paid off. I own about 30% ADA 30% SOL 20% XRP 20% ETH atm with how the market is going I think SOL just going to continue breaking records I’ve had it since it was at $30. ADA will pump soon I think really heavy and same with XRP. I think ETH Hits 10k eoty. Should I put ETH into my other alts or would you hold?
No matter how much you buy it’s always not enough
My car's check engine light is flashing indicating a serious problem, but thanks to crypto I'm not worried about it. I'll be walking to work from now on. Not selling lol
I feel a heavy BTC run tomorrow because of El Salvador

I feel like Dad just walked in the room when /u/Hodler3k shows up
There's the "dip" for ETH. Get in! DCA before 4k!
Damnit! Fooled again into posting in the old daily. I'm going to need all the Fs you can muster

I just heard from a friend in India that they are going to pass a bill soon wherein they will broadly define and classify cryptocurrency assets in India, this will be a big boost as they were planning to Ban crypto earlier. This is certainly Bullish, hope ppl have filled their bag of cryptos.
Thank u u/The_Don_Giggity for the award <3
**Only invest what you can afford to lose!**

Or 

**Only invest what you want to gain!** 

We will get to know which one holds good in a few years time.
The FOMO of SOL is hard. I don’t have any and it’s ATH every hour.
Staked ADA about a month ago. Now I have 2 ADA accumulated!! Free crypto
Listen if you are not on the Solana train, remember people said eth was too late at 300, 500, 1000 etc, I would suggest atleast having some Solana in your portfolio
Moons took a hit. Looks like I’ll have to rely on real crypto to fund my escape from the rat race.
Been converting my Coinbase card XLM reward to ALGO. Thankful for making that decision during this bull run.
If you’re feeling bad about missing out on sol there are plenty of other good projects that haven’t left the station yet for you to hop on
Solana levitating out of the charts

I’m debating in buying some more Reddit coins and going on an awarding frenzy… anyone going to stop me?

No?

Alright.
Vibe check

Kick back. The evening has settled in. Close your eyes for 15 seconds. Take a hit of that good good or go for a smoke break.
Greed index is very high right now
I bought btc at 56k we’re almost there!
It feels good to tip moons :)
If El Salvador figures out how to scale Bitcoin as a currency on a national scale effectively, the dominoes will fall quickly.
BTC $60k this month?Seems reasonable
That Solana portion of my portfolio pie chart lookin like a REAL slice of pizza
So I put it a buy order awhile back for some SOL at $25. It got down to roughly $26.75 and never went back that low again. Instead, I used the money to buy a case of #2 pencils to stab myself repeatedly with.
I threw some fun money into SOL a few weeks ago. That fun money is about to turn into serious money
This just in: SOL is going to the moon
If anyone is wondering why Solana has been going wild...


NFTs are super easy to buy and sell on Solanart.io and also very cheap and super fast! 

Their platform is actually insane and it's definitely starting to show..   

100B marketcap easily!
FTM and SOL absolutely killing it oh my god!
I told myself not to FOMO into SOL at £58....now £127 ahhhhh
me, with only 20% SOL in my portfolio, terrified for a crash
Ahhhh will forever remember the silly move of letting someone talk me out of SOL at $70.

&#x200B;

Why is it the one time I actually let myself be convinced was the best opp so far lol.
Congrats to all who holds SOL!
Which alts In your watchlist? I want to catch something like SOL
I wish I could SOLve my financial problems
I feel even worse for the people that sold SOL too early
daily’s moving so fast nobody will know that I didn’t buy sol
SOL is still cheap. Buy and wait. It will shoot up......this bull cycle is not end yet. I fomo'ed and enjoying.
Permission to name my first born son/daughter Solana?
Good luck SOL owners but I sure as hell aint buying in at this point.
Absolutely ridiculous what FTM and SOL have been doing
I got my girlfriend an Algorand wallet and gifted her some ALGO around a month back.

Now she thinks that I'm a crypto market expert. ![gif](emote|snoomoji_pack|joy)
Enough is enough. I'm done trying to resist FOMO. I bought a small bag of SOL... Oh crypto lord help me for I am weak.
Currently hodling 10 different coins, is that too many?
FTM has done a 6X in a month. Incredible gains. RIP to anyone who didn’t get in
I think $150 SOL is likely the floor if it ever comes down. But all logic is out of the window at the moment.
Watching SOL from the sidelines. How high can she go?
Another breakout for Eth? Looks to be testing resistence at $5400aud.
Damn I didn’t want to buy Solana at €100. Guess I missed out on 60% gains. It was still the right thing to not buy tho… but still…
A lot of people asking for the next pump.

&#x200B;

One upcoming one is HBAR. You're welcome.
converted some shitcoins into SOL. It will not stop at 250 or 300. Lets get close to 1k.
I think I’ll just sit on my positions now and stop adding. It’ll be interesting to see how high we can go before a correction. It’s just getting a bit too euphoric in the market so I’ll keep fiat on the side just in case
I’m the one who fomo-d into SOL two days ago with my last $10. 

I now have $13.
I was contemplating either Sol or ADA 2 weeks ago. I bought ADA and DOT and skipped Solana. 

If I had bought Solana instead I would be rich right now lol.
What is going on with SOL? If it goes on like this I really have to consider early retirement.
Sol is almost 200 our power level is over 9000 Vegeta !!!!!!!!!

![gif](giphy|dxld1UBIiGuoh31Fus)
SOL is at $193, holy shit!

ALGO got tired of being called stable coin
ALGO clawing its way up towards 1.6 and beyond.

Anyone believes a new ATH over 1.9 is possible in this run?

&#x200B;

![gif](giphy|toICmKwBns6ZO)
Algo up +12%

People on here: "bUt ThE tOkEnOmIcS"
Damn what happened to ADA?
VET continues to struggle to reach April’s ATH. 

Very disappointing for a token with so much potential.
Dont forget that if you wanna HODL, you dont have to check the charts all day
DOT recovering nicely from this mini-drop
I am slightly worried if the ADA dump is due to some insider knowing some upcoming bad news about ADA (e.g. smart contracts being delayed).  But then again, ADA does have some random dumps that down wick.  

The best case scenario is that a whale dumped to liquidate the leveraged longs and will begin another run soon.
People who just sold let's FOMO AGAIN AT HIGHER PRICE LOL
Newbies who fomod into ADA seeing the colour red on the charts for the first time

SOL’s strength in a BTC stumble is impressive
Market crashing on the first BTC day in Salvador. 

That's definitely going to make a nice first impression and make people trust crypto.
How bad your luck could be? Got fired last month, out of cash now, have to sell some coins in middle of bulk run when every coin has potential of being 2x-3x in matter of months. Today i gotta pay some bills and now every coin is in red. Sucks.     


Edit - Im green on all my coins just so you guys know. But these diamond hand shakes when selling.
This is somehow El Salvador's fault
Lol a little bit of red can cause a lot of mood swings over here... relax and zoom out!
fuck is ONE ever gonna stop docking around.

up to .20, back down to 0.14, up to 0.20, back to 0.14

SNIP SNAP SNIP SNAP
Think I'm gonna just stop checking charts for a few hours. As Heinz Ketchup says, good things come to those who wait
BTC drops 1% and people are fearing for a bear market already haha
SOL shining through this dip
Imagine buying a shit ton of Bitcoin for your country as the currency and it dips to 20k lol
Damn, should have cashed out ONE 20 mins ago lol. Goodbye my initial, it was nice to see you
What if, El Salvador bought the top and we are now going down in a bear. They would actually be totally fucked lol.
Everybody who said they were waiting for the dip, now is your chance!!
If prices are high, I sell for a profit.  If prices are low, I buy at discounts.  Life is simple for a shrimp such as myself.
What are you guys buying on this little "dip"? 
MATIC and DOT looks rather appealing.
Are we really freaking out because BTC dipped to 50.8k?
What is the worst crypto investment you ever made?
So the thing stopping me getting BTC is even if it goes to something like $200k per coin, that’s only 4 times higher than it’s current value so if I put in $5k I’d be waiting several years for a payout of $20k…I know that’s a good deal of money for some people but this is going to be my retirement fund and I can’t retire on $15k profit…I am hoping I am better off putting my money into ETH and hoping that one day reaches heights of the current BTC price
$762m longs just got liquidated. Can we take a moment for our fallen comrades.
I will keep DCAing into BTC. Regardless of what happens today, it will go up in the future.
I would like to read your opinions on MATIC being a technology that may change the world?
Is it still wise to DCA into ETH at this price ? Wouldn’t that push my average up if I bought in the 2K range and thus less profit?
The amount of liquidation today has reached 900 million and on 1 hour graph both btc and eth have taken a sharp dive. Nothing too much to be concerned about for non leveraged traders. Market is moving normally
Me waking up to my portfolio

![gif](giphy|l4FGGafcOHmrlQxG0|downsized)
Harmony One looks lost, in a good way
Meanwhile, SOL is like, you guys are dipping? Okay, imma head out
EL Salvador bought 0 doge
Brace yourself for the incoming gazillion posts about Panama bill to recognise BTC and ETH as payment methods

Edit: [source ](https://nitter.net/gabrielsilva8_7/status/1435015640226615299?s=20)
Can someone tell me more about LTO and what they bring to the table? Why is it an exciting project?
when people say today is buy Bitcoin day, they actually mean they already bought the day before and now it's time to sell
Can you guys see my comment?
What’s this? A dip for those tiny little sugar ants that take forever to get rid of?
Funny when you're bagholding, rallying to break even feels like profit
Portfolio down 40% - panik

Portfolio up 4% - kalm
El Salvador major organized worldwide pump n dump?
Wouldn't be a real dip without people starting to spread conspiracy theories about market manipulation and whales.
Kim k has been summoned by UK’s financial conduct authority for promoting a crypto token that could put investors at risk..
Time to consolidate to BTC, or let alts ride?
Why are my coins red? What did El salvador do?!?!
I missed the memo. Did everyone just decide to buy $30 of solana instead?
Today the world's eyes and ears are on El Salvador.
Why the dip today? I thought the El Salvador news would provide an excuse for a pump.
Buy the rumor. Buy the news. Buy the dip. Buy the pump. Equities, real estate and other mature markets are worth damn near 100 trillion. Crypto is worth about 1 trillion. At a minimum, this entire thing will eventually 10x in my stupid opinion. The odds of winning and winning big in the long term are ridiculously high, especially if you're invested in a top 5 project. But, do your own research.
Be sure to remember: most people giving crypto advice here are newbs trying to farm moons — same people who will probably panic sell today because of the dip so take their advice with a grain of salt — do your research and as always: DCA!
Yesterday I saw an ad on YouTube of someone claiming to send you back double the ADA you send him. How is YouTube letting such scams go around? Besides do people actually fall for this? Continuous eye roll tbh.
Bought my first Solana wahoo!
Bipolar chat is back ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dancing_wojak)![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dancing_wojak)
Who cares about a dip, BTC still gonna be 100k 3-6 months from now.
[rimosso]
I see the “Tuesday buy for El Salvador” is going about as expected.
Boy am I glad I took my altcoin profits back to BTC before this happened
Sold a portion of my ADA at $3 after being up more than 300% and took out my initial investment. Now i've got a bunch of crypto for free!
They are trying to make a mini Wyckoff distribution on the BTC daily chart. Idiots think I will sell after holding everything during a 60% dump. This time people have cash saved up fuckers.
dips are the only time i really feel comfortable. when im up 5x, i get so much doubts about if i should take profits or just long hodl

when it dips its easy, only one thing to do. Nothing!
You can't spell crypto without cry..
Guys no point in regret trading. If you've taken a sizable hit time to sit back analyze and get back when markets are healthy again. Don't loose your chips. You need chips to create more chips. If you run out of em you're done. Don't put yourself in that position by overtrading.
EXIT ALL CRYPTO MARKETS!! 

Or u know, just close binance for a little while.
Being optimistic, our homie, Ben Cowan, said that we needed a rest of the 20 day SMA which is at 47,917.96…looks like we are heading that way…so hoping for a nice support at that level and then head right back up!
It only takes a day to lose what it took months to build.
Gains that I have accumulated over last month wiped away in an hour
Sold everything two days ago to try to stay out of crypto. Guess it wants me back in…
Someone tell me it's gonna bounce back, please?
YOUVE ONLY LOST MONEY IF YOU SELL AT A LOSS. 

1 BTC = 1 BTC
I just literally bought something while it's up 10% then after a few minutes it's down 20%, instant -30% lmao
Wtf was that 47-48 jump rope hahahha
All my gains of the last month gone. All 40$
Had the feeling last night that I should take some profit right then and there - kicking myself today!
Dunno why, but i got really stoned and paranoid last night and sold everythint about 10pm.

Thank god.
Well what should i buy now?
El Salvador’s government must be so pissed right now lol
Boy sure fucking glad I bought ETH three different times today at $3700 because it was such a good deal
this is me right now looking at my portfolio...

Me: cmon Bitcoin have a 10k daily candle it’s been so long

If you're new here. Welcome to crypto :)
Ok now this is a GIANT sale
I'm shedding years off my lifespan. Maybe etfs are for me
I just bought like 5k in crypto this last weekend and got absolutely nuked
ETH just dumped 25% in 1 hour and then pumped 10% in minutes. The fuck is going on
All I can do is posts gifs 

![gif](giphy|XdDsb6psTES0eQo8Vg|downsized)
Took a month to be up 4k.

Down 4k in 24 hours....
you wanted a dip??? well here is your fucking dip!!
Erasing a months gain in 15 minutes. The things you can only see in crypto lmao
Time to move major USD into crypto now boys let's roll.

How much crypto you guys just see vanish from your portfolio? A little over a grand for me and it feels good! Buying more!!!!
Flash Crash. 

Always tough to resist the urge to sell during these, but I bought some more ETH instead.
Oh god cringing at dogshit "I love it when markets are down" posts and comments
this was expected lol. 


i obviously didn't know when and i lost money as well but there is no such thing as green candles everyday to the ATH. 


There were huge dips when we reached ATH this year too.
These crypto dips used to scare me. 

*yawn* we’ll be back
there was your dip sent from the heavens and you got scared instead lmao
It's not ogre...

RIght now the thing to do is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Don't buy, don't sell. We don't know how deep this will go, nor do we know when we will recover. 

Make no moves. Financial Advice, fite me.
Lol people stop dramatizing. You didn't lose a month of gains, you lost just one week.
CB having trouble taking my order lol
